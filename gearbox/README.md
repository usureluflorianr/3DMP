# Gearbox
The mechanism's name

## A short description and why you chose this mechanism
The gearbox is a mechanism used in cars. I chose this project, because the family business is anchored in this field.

## How it works and which are the main components/joints that are participating in the motion
The mechanism works using the size differences of the radii of the wheels that rotate depending on how we influence them

## What joint / component do you need to power, or what motion study do you need to play to see the motion
To use the mechanism you have to rotate the bar connected to the "motor" then move using the handle the other bar to select the desired speed

## What file types do you have in your repo (.f3d, .stl, .gcode, .stp, .igs, etc)
I posted .f3d files to show my progress during the project and also some png 

## Which software did you use to design and render the mechanism
I used Fusion360 for the whole project
